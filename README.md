# About this site

This is where [Joe Steinbring](https://jws.dev) dumps random knowledge (mostly involving web development things).  This site uses VuePress and you can view the files behind it [on github](https://github.com/steinbring/kb.jws.app).  Want to suggest a change to the site?  Fork it, send me a merge request, and I'll add your change.

# How is this site organized / updated?

The content of this site is stored in the markdown files in this root of this project.  Once a change is committed, deploy.sh is executed, the HTML/JS/CSS is generated, and the changes go live.  The sidebar's contents is controlled by config.js, as are a few other things.
